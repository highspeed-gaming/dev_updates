## What is this?
This repository is purely for community transparency with the changes that the development team are planning.

### Where can I suggest changes?
You can use the appropriate Discord channels to suggest things to be introduced into the server, alternatively, you can [create an issue][create-issue] on this repository - I'd recommend doing so, that way it is threaded and not lost.

[create-issue]: https://github.com/highspeed-gaming/dev_updates/issues/new
